<p><b>Web Safety Tips</b></p>

<p>Surfing on the internet can be lots of fun. It can also be dangerous if you don't follow certain rules.</p>
<p>Never give out personal information without asking your parents. Personal information includes:
	<li>your name</li>
	<li>your address</li>
	<li>your phone number</li>
	<li>your mom or dad's name</li>
	<li>the name of your school, your teacher or your friends</li>
</p>

<p>Never give away your internet password to anybody, even your best friend. It's a secret.</p>

<p>If you ever see anything on the web that makes you feel uncomfortable tell your parents right away so they can report it to
your online service provider.</p>

<p>Some sites have "chat" features that let you chat to people all over the world right from your computer. Make up a cool
nickname when you join a chat or a game online - Never use your real name.</p>

<p>If a person writes something that is mean or makes you feel uncomfortable, don't respond. Just LOG OFF and tell your parents
or an adult you can talk to so they can deal with it.</p>

<p>Don't share photos of yourself, your family, or your home with people you meet online.</p>

<p>Always delete unknown e-mail attachments without opening them. They can contain destructive viruses that will damage your
family's computer.</p>

<p>Never download anything without asking your parents or guardian first. These also can contain viruses.</p>

<p>Remember that nothing you write on the Web is completely private -- including e-mail. So be careful and think about what you
type and who you tell.</p>

<p>Not everyone is as nice, cute, and funny as they may sound online. Never make plans to meet an online "friend" in person.</p>

<p><b>WHEN IN DOUBT</b> -- always ask your parents for help -- and just <b>LOG OFF</b> if you're not sure! You can always go
back online later.</p>
