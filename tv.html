<img src="images/tv/ep01image.jpg" align="right" hspace="15">Tyson is at home practicing martial arts with his grandfather when suddenly he realizes he's late for a Beyblade battle with Andrew.  As he runs out of his house he's confronted by a couple of bullies who only slow him up for his real battle.  But when Tyson does show up, Andrew and his friends are met by a smart mouthed kid named Carlos who's a member of the notorious Blade Sharks. <p>

Carlos challenges anyone to a battle but the winner gets to keep the others Beyblades. Tyson accepts.  With the help of Kenny and his Bit Beast Dizzi, who's trapped inside his laptop, Tyson prepares for the big battle, which he handily wins.  But the just when the fight is over, the Blade Sharks' leader Kai shows up and a new battle begins between Kai and Tyson.

The Chief informs Tyson, that in order to beat Kai, you need a strategy, so Tyson goes home in an attempt to practice until he's perfected his fighting technique.  Later that day, Andrew and Kenny, along with Dizzi show up and attempt to increase the power of Tyson's blade to match that of Kai, but with little success. <p>

Tyson is feeling glum about his chances of ever beating Kai, but suddenly, out of nowhere, the Bit Beast Dragoon appears and flyes straight towards him and goes directly into Tyson's beyblade.  Tyson is stunned after realizing Dragoon does exists and is now inside his beyblade.   With renewed confidence, Tyson knows the time is right to challenge Kai once again to do battle

Now the Bladebreakers realize they're not as quite tough as they think they are and when they enter the ring for the final round, they try a new strategy. But Gary has other plans and makes quick work of defeating his inferior opponent handing a first round loss to our heroes.</p>

Turns out, the BBA Chairman had an ulterior motive- to teach the boys a valuable lesson about the importance of practice! Even Kenny learns from this and is able to tweak Ray's blade up a few notches. In the end, it's actually Kai who gets involved in Antonio's training that brings this life lesson to light!</p>

The winner of this round advances to the semi-finals. Their competition first appears to be a bunch of slackers, but when Ray loses out in the first round, they quickly realize what they're up against. Max is next, and for some odd reason, his rival folds under pressure, so the best of three is tied at one a piece with Tyson coming in for the deciding battle. At first it looks like a quick win for the Slammers simply because of the size of his opponents enormous Beyblade and things get even more tense when Tyson begins to lose his temper and his focus. The other Breakers convince him to concentrate and when he does, Tyson pull off the victory. Next, our heroes decide to check out the American Team who are competing in another stadium. That's where they get their first taste of the ultra-inflated ego of the All Starzs captain, Michael!</p>

But with sheer determination, Tyson pulls out a victory that puts the Bladebreakers ahead one to nothing in the best of three finals. The second round isn't quite so easy as Ray squares off against the NBA wanna-be Eddy who's blazing fast basketball style attack quickly knocks him out and evens the score at two a piece. It looks like the All Starz are shoe-ins to win because of their superior ability to collect data on their opponents. Now the stage is set for the final battle, but the question is, who from the Bladebreakers will take on the All Starz number one player Michael? In the end, it's Max who gets the nod.</p>

Robert then tells Tyson that he must harness his power back into his blade, which totally confuses Tyson. Finally, Kenny tells Tyson to remember a battle he had against Robert back in his castle. That's where Tyson realized he must work together with his Bit Beast. With this knowledge, a third battle takes place and Tyson defeats Robert. But the question still remained, why did the Majestics want to challenge our heroes to a battle for no apparent reason? In the end, it turns out Mr. Dickenson set this whole 'lesson' up to get the Bladebreakers ready for the final match with the Demolition Boys. Without accessing their 'power from within', the Bladebreakers wouldn't stand a chance against the Demolition Boys in the finals at the World Championships.</p>

	<img src="images/tv/ep48image.jpg" align="right" hspace="15">The World Championship Finals are finally here and Kai insists on Beybattling first, hoping his knowledge of the Demolition Boys will give him an advantage over Spencer. But in the first set, Seaborg, Spencer's whale Bit Beast, uses the water in the Black Sea Bowl to create a tsunami, which overwhelms Dranzer. Kai is desperate for victory and Voltaire makes him a tempting offer: the power of Black Dranzer in exchange for betraying his friends and stealing their Bit Beasts. Kai stays true to his heart and resists his grandfather.</p>

When it's discovered that Bryan's attack includes the ability to manipulate air itself into a weapon, Ray faces a troubling realization. To negate Bryan's fury, he must put his own well being at risk. But Ray's Bit-Beast Driger has other ideas, and it offers up selfless act of its own.</p>
