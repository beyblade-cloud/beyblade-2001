		<td width="100%"><p class="headline">TYSON<p><b>Team:  Bladebreakers</b><br>
Tyson is a bright young teenager who�s not afraid to speak his mind and in so doing, he seems to get into more trouble than most boys his age.  Even though he�s not very big in stature, he is strong willed and very little seems to frighten him.  He�s curious and at times will act in haste when dealing with some of life�s little dilemmas.  Although Tyson is not a born leader, his magnetic personality and self-confidence seem to gravitate people toward him.<p>

In Beyblading, Tyson�s Bit Beast is <b>Dragoon</b> and his style of play is aggressive.  All in all, Tyson is one fierce competitor!

When Kai first appears, he is portrayed as a cold hearted competitor and the ultimate nemesis of Tyson.  As the leader of the Shell Sharks, he and his gang use their superior skills to win (or should we say steal) their competitors� Beyblade equipment.  But after Tyson challenges him to a battle, the two become team mates.  <p>

Kai�s Bit Beast is <b>Dranzer</b> and his fighting style is vicious.  He has a �take no prisoners� mentality and likes to keep his battles short, leaving opponents wondering what hit them.

Max is like a brother to Tyson and is the best friend any kid could have.  He is bright, cheerful and always ready to take on a new Beyblade challenge.  Max is a true strategist and when it comes to battling he is a strong competitor, always looking for a new angle or tactic to win.  He is a master of the defensive move and even more interesting, his style is completely opposite to Tyson�s. <p>

Max has learned to unleash his Bit Beast <b>Draciel</b> and the key to his game is defense and strategy.

Ray is another member of Tyson�s Bladebreakers team.  He may be quiet, but beneath his low-key demeanor is an incredibly confident young teenager.  Ray always looks before he leaps, especially when it comes to Beyblade battles.  <p>

Ray�s Beyblade is powered by the Bit Beast <b>Driger</b>.

		<td width="100%"><p class="headline">KENNY (Chief)<p><b>Team:  Bladebreakers</b><br>
A self-described nerd, Kenny never goes anywhere without his trusty laptop.  That�s where he has amassed every known statistic on Beybladers and their Beyblades.  Kenny can call up in an instant a player�s ranking or, with a few quick keystrokes, a detailed analysis of the mechanical workings on any Beyblade in existence.  Although Kenny possesses zero talent in the athletic department, he is a valuable asset to his teammates. <p>

Kenny's Bit Beast is <b>Dizzara (�Dizzi�)</b>, who, due to a freak power surge, has become trapped in his laptop computer.  As such, she has knowledge of all the other Bit Beasts, including their strengths and weaknesses.  She's a sarcastic smarty-pants, but not in an unfriendly way.  She truly enjoys hanging around with Kenny and his pals, no matter how many off-handed comments she makes.
